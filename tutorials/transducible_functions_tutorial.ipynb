    "This enforces strong typing and guarantees predictable I/O behavior.\n",

    "- A TARGET Pydantic object: If the function directly returns an instance of the TARGET type, no LLM call is made — the function behaves as a pure Python transformation.\n",
    "- B. Transduce(obj) :If it returns Transduce(obj) (where obj is a SOURCE-type Pydantic object), this triggers an LLM-based transduction, meaning: the input object is serialized, instructions are applied, the LLM produces an output object of the TARGET type via structured decoding.\n",
