    "\n",
    "AG (shorthand for **Agentics**) is the basic data structure used to **encapsulate data for logical transduction**. You can think of it as a *typed container* that holds a list of Pydantic objects (its `states`) together with their shared schema (the `atype`). Once your data lives inside an `AG`, it becomes a first-class citizen in the Agentics world: it can be mapped, reduced, transformed, and enriched by transducible functions, all while preserving type information and explainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use `AG` with a simple `Movie` type to show how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- define an `atype` (a Pydantic model),\n",
    "- wrap it in an `AG` instance,\n",
    "- treat the `AG` as a **typed list** (append, index, iterate),\n",
    "- and load/save its contents to CSV and JSONL files.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets the foundation for later steps, where the same `AG` pattern will power **logical transduction**, Map–Reduce operations, and more complex agentic workflows."

    "Agentics and transducible functions are designed to work hand in hand.  \n",
    "An `AG` gives you a **typed collection of states** (e.g. a list of `Movie`, `Email`, or `Product` objects), while a transducible function defines a **typed transformation** between two Pydantic models (e.g. `Genre << Movie`, `Summary << Email`).\n",
