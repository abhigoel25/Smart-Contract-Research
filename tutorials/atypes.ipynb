    "The most basic agentic building block in Agentics is the **TYPE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **TYPE** is a typed state schema, implemented as a Pydantic `BaseModel`, that describes **what a piece of information looks like** in your workflow. Instead of passing around loose dicts or ad-hoc JSON, you work with well-defined ATypes that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specify **fields**, **types**, and **descriptions** (e.g. `name: str`, `age: int | None`).\n",
    "- Act as the **input and output types** of transducible functions.\n",
    "- Provide a **stable contract** between different stages of your pipeline (ingestion → enrichment → classification → summarization, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of an Type as the “vocabulary word” for your agentic system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `UserMessage`, `EmailDraft`, `ProductReview`, `Movie`, `Summary`, `SQLQuery`, ...\n",
    "- Each one captures a coherent **state of the world** at some step of reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because ATypes are just Pydantic models, you automatically get:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validation and normalization of incoming data.\n",
    "- Rich metadata (field descriptions) that guide LLM behavior.\n",
    "- Compatibility with Map–Reduce, memory, and transducible composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you’ll spend much of your time in Agentics **defining, refining, and composing ATypes**, and then wiring them together with transducible functions to form robust, structured reasoning pipelines."
