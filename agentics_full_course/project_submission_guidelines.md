# 🧭 Student Workshop Project Preparation Guide

Each team is required to submit the following materials **at least one week before the workshop presentation**.

---

## 📝 1. Project Description Write-Up

Prepare a short paper following a **conference-style format**, including these sections:

### Introduction
Describe your institutional domain and the specific problem you are addressing.

### Related Work
Summarize previous research, systems, or benchmarks relevant to your topic.

### Technical Solution
Explain how you used **Agentic AI** to solve the problem, describing your system architecture, agentic design, and reasoning mechanisms.

### Evaluation and Benchmarks
Provide experimental results, metrics, or benchmark comparisons that demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of your approach.

### Conclusion
Summarize your key findings, discuss limitations, and suggest future extensions or applications.

## 💻 2. Runnable Code Release (Agentics Git Forks)

Release your runnable code in your **Agentics GitHub fork**, by creating a new folder under:

📂 [https://github.com/IBM/Agentics/tree/main/applications](https://github.com/IBM/Agentics/tree/main/applications)

Your project folder should be named after your project and organized as follows:

/<project_name>
│
├── README.md         # Installation and testing instructions
├── src/              # Source code
├── docs/             # Documentation (paper, slides, notes, etc.)

### Notes
- The code will be **peer-reviewed** by other students and professors.
- If you plan to release your project publicly, include a **permissive open-source license** (preferably MIT) in your project folder.

---

## 🎥 3. Video Presentation

Create a **5-minute recorded video** presenting your project.

- Introduce the project goals, methods, and key results.  
- Optionally include a demo or short code walkthrough with slides.  
- You will present the same video **in person** during the student workshop.

---

## 👩‍🏫 4. Faculty Feedback Meeting

Schedule a meeting with professors **at least two weeks before the final submission** to receive feedback on:

- The draft of your short paper  
- Your runnable code and documentation  
- Your recorded video presentation
