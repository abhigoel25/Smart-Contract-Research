  "issues": [
    "Lack of access control on the fulfillObligation function allows any user to fulfill any obligation, which could lead to unauthorized fulfillment.",
    "The party addresses are initialized to address(0), making it impossible to validate which party is fulfilling obligations.",
    "Potential timestamp manipulation issues with the use of block.timestamp or block.number for deadlines.",
    "Obligation fulfillment does not have any condition checks to ensure that the caller is indeed the party that is supposed to fulfill the obligation."

  "recommendations": [
    "Implement access control to restrict who can call the fulfillObligation function, such as checking that msg.sender is the party involved.",
    "Store actual addresses of the parties in the Party struct instead of initializing them to address(0).",
    "Consider using an oracle or another source for reliable timestamping to mitigate manipulation risks.",
    "Add checks to ensure that only the appropriate party can fulfill the obligation to prevent unauthorized fulfillments."
