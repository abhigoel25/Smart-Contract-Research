    "The lender and borrower addresses are hardcoded as zero addresses, which can lead to complications. It is recommended to set these addresses at deployment, to ensure the correct parties are associated with the contract.",
    "The financial terms include amounts in USD but do not implement a method for conversion or checking the validity of payments, which may lead to inconsistencies or misuse.",
    "The makePayment function lacks checks to ensure only the borrower can make payments, which may lead to unauthorized payments being made by anyone.",
    "The fulfillObligation function does not ensure that conditions for fulfilling obligations are checked, which could lead to obligations being marked as fulfilled without actual compliance."

  "recommendations": [
    "Modify the contract to accept the lender and borrower addresses as constructor parameters to prevent using default zero addresses.",
    "Implement validation for financial terms and payment handling to accommodate potential currency conversion and differing values.",
    "Restrict the makePayment function to only allow the borrower to call it using an 'onlyBorrower' modifier, ensuring only authorized payments occur.",
    "Add conditions to check for the completion of obligations before allowing fulfillment to prevent incorrect state changes."
