    "Use of 'string' type for addresses and dates can lead to inefficiencies and potential data integrity problems. Strings can be easily manipulated and may not enforce specific formats.",
    "The contract has insufficient access control mechanisms. Anyone can call the 'fulfillObligation' function, without checks to validate the caller or their permissions.",

    "Consider using 'bytes32' for fixed-size identifiers or MD5/SHA hashes for parties' addresses and other identifiers to ensure efficiency and security.",
    "Implement appropriate access control mechanisms (e.g., using modifiers to restrict access to certain functions to specific users or roles).",
    "Add functions to allow modification of contract details by authorized parties. This could involve using a multi-signature mechanism to ensure security during updates."
