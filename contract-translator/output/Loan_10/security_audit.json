  "severity_level": "medium",

  "issues": [
    "The lender and borrower addresses are initialized to zero addresses (addresses not defined). This could lead to issues when trying to validate transaction participants.",
    "No access control or authorization is implemented for critical functions like performLoanDisbursement and makePayment, which could allow unauthorized users to call these functions.",
    "Lack of input validation for the amount in makePayment could allow for excessive payments that could affect the loan state.",
    "Date fields are stored as strings, which can lead to inconsistencies and make it difficult to handle date-based logic.",
    "Events do not contain a unique identifier for tracking loan payments or disbursements; adding transaction IDs or timestamps could improve traceability."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Set valid addresses for lender and borrower, or allow them to be specified during deployment.",
    "Implement access control mechanisms (e.g., ownership or role-based access) to restrict critical function execution to authorized parties only.",
    "Add input validation in makePayment to restrict values to a reasonable range and ensure it doesn't exceed the loan amount or required installment.",
    "Consider changing date fields to a standard format, such as uint256 timestamps, for easier arithmetic and comparison.",
    "Enhance the emitted events to include identifiers or transaction details for better tracking."
