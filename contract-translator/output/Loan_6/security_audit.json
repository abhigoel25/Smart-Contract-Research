  "issues": [
    "The wallet addresses for lender and borrower are initially set to address(0). This could lead to confusion or misuse if these addresses are not updated before the contract is used.",
    "Payment processing functionality lacks validation to ensure that only the lender or borrower can initiate payments and that the payment amount is valid with respect to loan terms.",
    "No mechanism to update financial terms, obligations, or conditions after the contract creation could result in rigidity if terms need to change.",
    "Lack of access control mechanisms can expose sensitive functionalities to anyone who interacts with the contract."

  "recommendations": [
    "Ensure that the lender and borrower wallet addresses are set correctly during construction or provide a mechanism to update them securely.",
    "Implement modifiers to restrict access to payments and sensitive data to authorized users only (e.g., only the lender can process payments).",
    "Consider adding functions to allow parties to modify or renegotiate financial terms and obligations in a secure manner.",
    "Add input validation for financial terms and payment processing to prevent nonsensical or malicious values being passed."
