  "issues": [
    "The 'contributeCapital' function emits an event for capital contribution but does not actually transfer any funds, which may lead to confusion about the state of capital contribution.",
    "The contract does not validate that the 'party' in the 'assignObligation' function corresponds to an active partner, which could lead to inconsistencies in obligations.",
    "The use of string types for identifying parties and financial terms may lead to potential issues with data integrity and querying.",
    "The current implementation does not include functionality for handling potential reentrancy attacks when dealing with fund transfers (if implemented in the future)."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement actual fund transfer logic in the 'contributeCapital' function and validate against the necessary ERC20/ERC721 standards.",
    "Add a check in the 'assignObligation' function to ensure that the provided party exists and is active.",
    "Consider using a more robust way to identify parties, such as an enumeration or a mapping for better integrity and efficiency.",
    "Introduce mechanisms to handle reentrancy issues, possibly by using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern if any external calls are made in future function implementations."
