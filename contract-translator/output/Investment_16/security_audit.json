  "issues": [
    "The contract does not validate the addresses of the company and investor, which are initialized to address(0). This could lead to potential misuse if these addresses are not later updated.",
    "The financial terms are initialized with large values in ether; there are no safeguards in place to prevent incorrect values from being set in future updates.",
    "The obligation fulfillment method does not check for the caller's permissions, allowing anyone to fulfill the obligation.",
    "Date representations as strings can lead to inconsistencies; consider using a more structured format such as uint256 timestamps."

  "recommendations": [
    "Add input validation for the company and investor addresses to ensure they are not set to address(0).",
    "Implement access controls on the fulfillCompanyObligation method to ensure that only authorized users can fulfill obligations.",
    "Change date representations to use uint256 timestamps instead of strings for better handling and comparison.",
    "Consider adding further validation on financial terms, ensuring that amounts are positive and in reasonable ranges."
