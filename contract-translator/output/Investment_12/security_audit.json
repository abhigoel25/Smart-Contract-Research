    "The contract does not handle the addresses for the company and investor. Using address(0) raises concerns and may lead to vulnerabilities if not addressed properly.",
    "The 'parseDate' function is a stub with no implementation. This can introduce issues related to date handling and could allow invalid date checks.",
    "There are no mechanisms for transferring funds or shares. Any financial transactions remain speculative as the contract lacks necessary controls.",
    "The triggerInvestment and redeemShares functions have no access control, meaning any user can call these functions without proper authorization, which poses a security risk."

  "recommendations": [
    "Implement proper checks to assign valid addresses to company and investor instead of using address(0). Consider adding functions to set these addresses securely.",
    "Fully implement the 'parseDate' function to correctly convert date strings into UNIX timestamps to ensure accurate deadline checks and operations.",
    "Introduce mechanisms to handle fund transfers, such as receiving and sending Ether tokens or handling share distributions.",
    "Add access control for the 'triggerInvestment' and 'redeemShares' functions. Consider using modifiers or role-based access controls to restrict who can call these functions."
