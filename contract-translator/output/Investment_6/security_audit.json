    "The 'makeInvestment' function allows anyone to reset the investment amount to a fixed value, which could lead to incorrect states if called multiple times.",
    "The current implementation does not enforce any checks on who can call the 'redeemShares' function. This could allow anyone to redeem shares, potentially causing financial loss."

    "Add access control to the 'makeInvestment' and 'redeemShares' functions to restrict access to authorized personnel only.",
    "Consider implementing a payable function for investment that accepts ETH or tokens, rather than hardcoding the investment amount.",
    "Remove the ability to reset investment amounts from the 'makeInvestment' function or allow for only certain conditions to change it."
