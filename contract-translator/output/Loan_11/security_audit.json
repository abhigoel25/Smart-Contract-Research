    "No access control in 'initializeAgreement', allowing anyone to initialize the agreement.",

    "Implement access control on 'initializeAgreement' to restrict who can initialize or modify the loan agreement.",

    "Include a state variable to track the status of the loan (e.g., active, paid off, defaulted).",
