    "The onlyReceivingParty modifier uses msg.sender == address(this), which is incorrect. It should check against the actual address of the receiving party, which is not stored in the contract.",
    "The NDA's startDate is set in the future, which might not be relevant for all use cases or could lead to confusion for users who require immediate execution.",
    "No access control for the constructor or functions that manipulate NDA terms after creation; this could lead to unauthorized changes if the logic is extended.",
    "The obligations array is mutable and can be updated without restrictions, potentially leading to issues such as deleting obligations or adding new ones without authority.",
    "An external call to fulfillObligation can lead to unexpected behavior if not properly controlled and tested, particularly if it relies on external Oracle or service to validate obligations.",
    "Event emissions should have standardized information about the sender and action type for better tracking and auditing."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Update the onlyReceivingParty modifier to validate msg.sender against a stored address for the receiving party.",
    "Consider a mechanism to initialize and validate obligations that prevents unauthorized changes post-deployment.",
    "Implement proper access control and perhaps ownership for the contract to ensure only authorized entities can modify NDA conditions.",
    "Provide functionality to immutably check obligations, such as a completed flag or tactic to finalize obligations once met.",
    "Enhance the event emission structure to include details on the sender and specifically what action is being handled.",
    "Reconsider the utility and implications of having a future startDate; provide mechanisms to handle dated conditions in a relevant way."
