    "The lender and borrower addresses are initialized to zero address, which may lead to ambiguities in identifying parties involved in the agreement.",
    "The contract does not enforce ownership or access control for action functions, potentially allowing anyone to call them.",
    "No mechanisms are in place to prevent reentrancy or ensure that critical state changes are atomic, which could expose functions like `prepayLoan` to unintended behaviors.",
    "Obligations and financial terms are set in the constructor but cannot be updated or modified later, limiting the contract's flexibility."

  "recommendations": [
    "Implement proper address initialization for lender and borrower or allow them to be set upon deployment by the owner.",
    "Add ownership or access control through an owner variable or using OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract to restrict access to action functions.",
    "Consider implementing safety checks within state-changing functions to prevent reentrancy attacks and ensure that all critical state changes are encapsulated properly.",
    "Provide functions to modify obligations and financial terms in case the parties wish to renegotiate the agreement terms."
