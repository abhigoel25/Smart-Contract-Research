    "The constructor initializes borrower address as address(0), which is not a valid address for actual deployment.",
    "The makePayment function does not include any logic for transferring funds, which may lead to misunderstanding on the expected functionality.",
    "The acknowledgeObligation function does not perform any action despite having an index check.",
    "The FinancialTerm for late payment fee has an amount of 0, which may lead to unintended behavior.",
    "Return values for getters do not account for out-of-bounds indices properly - they return empty values instead of reverting or throwing an error."

  "recommendations": [
    "Replace address(0) for borrower with a valid address or include validation requirements to ensure a valid address is provided.",
    "Implement actual fund transfer logic in the makePayment function to handle payments appropriately.",
    "Implement actual functionality in acknowledgeObligation, such as marking the obligation as acknowledged or tracking acknowledgments.",
    "Set a non-zero value for the late payment fee to appropriately enforce penalties.",
    "Consider implementing revert statements in getter functions for out-of-bounds access instead of returning empty values."
