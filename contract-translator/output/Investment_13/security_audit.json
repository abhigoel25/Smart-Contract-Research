  "severity_level": "medium",
  "approved": false,
  "issues": [
    "1. Lack of access control: The constructor does not set the companyAddress and investorAddress, meaning these addresses can never be changed after deployment. This may adversely affect ownership and governance.",
    "2. No functions to set or update critical parameters like companyAddress or investorAddress, limiting contract flexibility and adaptability.",
    "3. The redeemShares function emits a redemption event without any checks or actual redemption logic, which could lead to misuse or confusion.",
    "4. The processInvestment function does not validate the incoming investment, allowing for arbitrary events to be emitted with any amount, leading to potential misuse.",
    "5. Potential denial of service if the contract's obligation party is empty, as redeemShares will not perform as expected."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "1. Introduce functions to set/update the companyAddress and investorAddress, ideally with access control to restrict access to only authorized parties.",
    "2. Implement the actual logic and conditions for redeeming shares in the redeemShares function, to ensure it performs the intended functionality.",
    "3. Add validation in the processInvestment function to ensure that the amount is significant and from an authorized caller.",
    "4. Consider implementing checks in redeemShares that ensure obligations are valid before proceeding with the redemption.",
    "5. Establish a mechanism for managing investment amounts and ensuring they align with the financial allocations ideally with further checks.",
    "6. Implement proper access control (owner or admin role) for sensitive functions."
