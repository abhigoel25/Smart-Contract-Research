    "Functions (makePayment and fulfillObligation) do not have access control, which could allow unauthorized users to call them.",
    "The constructor initializes the lender and borrower addresses to address(0), which can lead to issues if these addresses are expected to be valid and later interactions are attempted.",
    "The contract has no functions for the lender or borrower to set their respective addresses, making it impossible to utilize the loan agreement effectively.",

  "recommendations": [
    "Implement access control to ensure only the borrower can call makePayment and fulfillObligation functions.",
    "Allow the lender and borrower to set their addresses in the constructor or through dedicated functions after contract deployment.",
    "Include checks in the makePayment function to ensure the amount sent is valid and expected to prevent abuse.",
    "Consider adding a status or ownership variable to manage states of the contract clearly."
