    "Employer and employee addresses are hardcoded in the constructor, which limits flexibility and could be a risk if used in a production environment.",
    "Lack of access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modifications to sensitive data such as salary or obligations.",
    "No checks on array bounds when accessing employerObligations or employeeObligations, potentially leading to out-of-bounds read.",
    "No functions for updating the employer or employee addresses, which may be necessary in real-world use cases."

  "recommendations": [
    "Replace hardcoded addresses with parameters in the constructor to enable flexibility and configurability.",
    "Implement access control mechanisms (e.g., Ownable pattern) to restrict who can modify sensitive information.",
    "Add require statements to ensure array indices accessed in getEmployerObligation and getEmployeeObligation are within bounds.",
    "Consider adding functions to update the employer, employee, salary, and obligations as needed."
