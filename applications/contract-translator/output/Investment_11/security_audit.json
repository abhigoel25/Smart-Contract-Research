  "severity_level": "medium",

  "issues": [
    "1. Lack of access control: Public functions such as invest(), redeemShares(), and addSpecialTerm() can be called by anyone, potentially allowing unauthorized actions.",
    "2. No validation on the investor and company addresses: The addresses for company and investor are set to address(0) in the constructor which means they cannot be interacted with correctly. This could cause issues in the contract's logic.",
    "3. No reentrancy protection in invest() and redeemShares() functions, which could allow unexpected state changes if an external contract calls these functions."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "1. Implement access control using modifiers (like `onlyOwner`) to restrict who can call certain functions.",
    "2. Modify the constructor to require the correct addresses for the company and the investor, and potentially add functions to modify these later securely.",
    "3. Consider implementing reentrancy guards in critical functions, particularly those that change the state or assets of the contract."
