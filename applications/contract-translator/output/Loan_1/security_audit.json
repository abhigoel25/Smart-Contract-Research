  "issues": [
    "Fixed timestamps for important dates (loanStartDate, disbursementDate, firstPaymentDueDate, loanTermEndDate) which may lead to issues in real-world scenarios.",
    "The 'makePayment' function does not handle overpayment; it assumes the borrower pays exactly the required amount.",
    "Loan default logic is triggered only when 'remainingBalance' goes below or equal to zero, which may not include scenarios where the borrower stops making payments altogether.",
    "The contract does not contain a mechanism for allowing the borrower to pay off the loan early, which can be a disadvantage."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Consider using block numbers or intervals rather than fixed timestamps for critical dates to improve flexibility.",
    "Implement logic in 'makePayment' to handle overpayments or implement a refund system.",
    "Revise the loan default logic to handle cases where payments are missed without necessarily waiting for the balance to reach zero.",
    "Provide functionality to allow the borrower to pay off the loan early or renegotiate terms."
