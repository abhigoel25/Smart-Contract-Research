  "issues": [
    "Lender and borrower addresses are not set through the constructor which could lead to the contract being unusable.",
    "Loan disbursement and payment functions lack proper access control; anyone can trigger these functions.",
    "Dates are handled as strings which makes it difficult to validate or manipulate dates correctly.",
    "The contract lacks logic for actual payment processing, handling collateral, or address verification.",
    "Obligation performance emits an event without checking who is calling the function, which might allow anyone to claim an obligation has been performed."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Set the lender and borrower addresses during contract deployment via the constructor to ensure accountability.",
    "Implement access control to the `disburseLoan` and `makeMonthlyPayment` functions to restrict who can call these functions. Consider using the `onlyLender` or `onlyBorrower` modifiers.",
    "Use uint or another appropriate structure to accurately handle dates instead of strings, allowing for easier validation and manipulation.",
    "Implement payment logic that verifies payment amounts and updates states accordingly.",
    "Add validation checks in the `performObligation` function to ensure only authorized parties can perform obligations."
