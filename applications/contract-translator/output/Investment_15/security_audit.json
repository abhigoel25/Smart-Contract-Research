    "Company and investor addresses can be set to zero addresses, potentially leading to loss of access to important functionalities.",
    "Lack of access control on critical functions which allows anyone to change financial terms and dates.",
    "Incomplete implementations of obligation fulfillment functions, giving the potential to emit events without validation.",
    "No validation or checks on the logic flow in makeInvestment, fulfillCompanyObligation, and fulfillInvestorObligation, which could allow unintended effects."

  "recommendations": [
    "Implement access control measures (e.g., Ownable pattern) to restrict who can set addresses and financial terms.",
    "Ensure that setting addresses cannot be done to address(0) or provide mechanisms to prevent it.",
    "Validate that obligations are being fulfilled properly before emitting events.",
    "Enhance makeInvestment to revert on zero value investments or provide meaningful feedback to the caller.",
    "Consider introducing modifiers or require statements to enforce logic before executing critical functions."
