    "Potential for reentrancy attack in the `disburseLoan` and `makePayment` functions, as funds are transferred before the state is updated.",
    "Lack of checks to ensure that `makePayment` can only be called if the loan is in an active state.",

    "Implement a reentrancy guard to prevent potential reentrancy attacks.",
    "Add a status variable to represent if the loan is active or not and check for it in `makePayment`.",

    "Consider adding more flexible payment terms in line with real-world scenarios."
