    "The contract does not check for the correct quantity of shares being redeemed. An arbitrary quantity can be passed without validation.",
    "The contract allows the investor to call the makeInvestment() function without any actual transfer of funds, leading to potential misuse.",

    "Implement a check in the redeemShares() function to ensure that the quantity redeemed does not exceed the available shares.",
