  "issues": [
    "The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms, which can lead to unauthorized access to critical functions.",
    "Functions that deal with payments (payLoan, payMonthly) are not implemented, which poses a risk as there are no guidelines on how payments are processed.",
    "The use of plain strings for roles (e.g., 'Borrower', 'Lender') is prone to human error and may lead to inconsistencies.",
    "The contract does not include any mechanisms to validate the addresses of the lender and borrower, leaving room for potential fraud if used in a real application.",
    "Event emissions do not handle the cases of loan payment processing; it could be more informative."

  "recommendations": [
    "Implement access control (e.g., using modifiers) to restrict who can call certain functions.",
    "Finalize the logic for the payment functions to ensure they adequately process payments and may include validation checks.",
    "Replace the string identifiers for roles with enumerated types for better reliability.",
    "Introduce address validation before assigning lender and borrower addresses to ensure that they are legitimate.",
    "Enhance event logging for the payment functions to provide clearer information about transaction outcomes."
