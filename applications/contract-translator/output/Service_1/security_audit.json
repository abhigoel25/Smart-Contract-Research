    "Hardcoded client address can lead to issues if the address needs to be changed.",

    "Fee payments are restricted to once a month, which may not be ideal for all payment scenarios.",
    "Incorrect usage of percentages (e.g., annual increase should use a different mechanism for tracking).",

    "Allow dynamic setting of the client address instead of hardcoding it in the constructor.",
