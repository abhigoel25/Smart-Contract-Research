                CRITICAL GENERATION RULES - STRICT COMPLIANCE REQUIRED:
                
                1. SEMANTIC FIDELITY OVER NAME MATCHING
                   - Never generate functions without FULL implementation
                   - No placeholder logic, no "// logic goes here" comments
                   - Every function mentioned must have complete, executable behavior
                
                2. EXPLICIT STATE MACHINE ENFORCEMENT
                   - All states must be reachable and mutually exclusive
                   - State transitions use require() with clear error messages
                   - Never allow invalid state transitions
                   - Every state-dependent function must enforce valid state with require()
                
                3. ACCESS CONTROL MUST BE ENFORCED
                   - All administrative functions use modifiers (onlyOwner, onlyRole, etc)
                   - No state-changing function callable by arbitrary addresses unless specified
                   - Define and use access roles consistently
                
                4. NO SILENT FAILURES - PROHIBITED PATTERN
                   - NEVER use: if (condition) return;
                   - ALWAYS use: require(condition, "Error message");
                   - All invalid conditions MUST revert with descriptive messages
                
                5. ECONOMIC LOGIC MUST BE COMPLETE
                   - If pricing/fees/swaps/payments mentioned: implement ALL calculations
                   - Funds MUST be transferred or accounted for
                   - Variables like price, feeRate, amountRaised MUST be read and written in live logic
                   - No passive declarations - every financial variable must affect behavior
                
                6. TIME-BASED CONDITIONS MUST BE ENFORCED
                   - If deadlines/start times/durations mentioned: store AND check using block.timestamp
                   - Time variables MUST affect contract behavior
                   - Implement automatic state transitions based on time
                
                7. EVENT SEMANTICS MUST MATCH ACTIONS
                   - Events represent real, completed actions only
                   - Each state change or economic transfer emits separate, specific event
                   - Never merge unrelated actions into single event (e.g., no "TransferAndApproval")
                   - Event names must be clear: Transfer, Approval, Swap, Paused, etc
                
                8. NO UNUSED OR DECORATIVE CODE
                   - Every variable, state, function, event MUST be actively used
                   - If something cannot be implemented: either infer reasonable behavior or omit it
                   - No "filler" code
                
                9. STANDARD SOLIDITY SAFETY - MANDATORY
                   - Use require() for all validation
                   - Validate zero addresses
                   - Ensure invariants (e.g., total supply consistency)
                   - Use SafeMath patterns where needed
                
                10. INTERNAL COHERENCE REQUIRED
                    - Names must reflect actual behavior
                    - States correspond to real operational modes
                    - Functions must not contradict each other
                    - Variables must not represent multiple concepts
                
                FORBIDDEN PATTERNS:
                - Empty function bodies
                - Unused state variables
                - Silent failures (if/return pattern)
                - Placeholder comments
                - Decorative events that don't represent real actions
                - State variables that are never read
                - Time variables that are never checked
                - Access-controlled functions without modifiers

MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:
□ All functions have COMPLETE implementation (no "// TODO" or empty bodies)
□ All financial variables (price, fee, amount) are USED in calculations
□ All time variables (deadline, startTime) are CHECKED with block.timestamp
□ All state transitions use require() to prevent invalid changes
□ All administrative functions have access control modifiers
□ All economic transfers actually move funds (msg.value, transfer calls)
□ All events are emitted when their corresponding action completes
□ No silent failures - all invalid conditions revert with require()
□ All declared variables are read or written in at least one function
□ State machine is complete - all states are reachable and have transitions

ABI SUMMARY:

- Non-payable functions: {len(nonpayable_functions)}
- View functions: {len(view_functions)}

COMPLETE ABI:
{json.dumps(abi, indent=2)}

FUNCTION DETAILS:
{function_details}

Generate a Python MCP server file with CORRECT FastMCP API:

1. **Imports (MUST use FastMCP, not old MCP)**:
   ```python
   import os
   import json
   from pathlib import Path
   from web3 import Web3
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   from fastmcp import FastMCP
   ```

2. **Setup (Load .env from SAME DIRECTORY as script, Load ABI from .abi.json file)**:
   ```python
   import os
   import json
   from pathlib import Path
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   
   # Load .env from the same directory as this script
   env_path = Path(__file__).parent / '.env'
   load_dotenv(dotenv_path=env_path)
   
   # Load ABI from the same directory as this script
   abi_path = Path(__file__).parent / '{contract_name}.abi.json'
   with open(abi_path, 'r') as f:
       contract_abi = json.load(f)
   
   RPC_URL = os.getenv('RPC_URL')
   PRIVATE_KEY = os.getenv('PRIVATE_KEY')
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS = os.getenv('CONTRACT_ADDRESS')
   
   web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(RPC_URL))
   account = web3.eth.account.from_key(PRIVATE_KEY)
   contract = web3.eth.contract(address=Web3.to_checksum_address(CONTRACT_ADDRESS), abi=contract_abi)
   ```

3. **Create FastMCP instance**:
   ```python
   mcp = FastMCP("{contract_name}")
   ```

4. **Create @mcp.tool() decorated functions for EACH ABI function**:
   
   For PAYABLE functions:
   - Build transaction with correct value
   - Sign and send transaction
   - Return {{"tx_hash": hash}}
   
   For NON-PAYABLE functions:
   - Build transaction (no value)
   - Sign and send transaction
   - Return {{"tx_hash": hash}}
   
   For VIEW functions:
   - Call function (read-only)
   - Return result directly
   
5. **Documentation**:
   - Each @mcp.tool() function must have docstring
   - Explain what it does, who can call it, parameters, return value
   - Handle errors gracefully

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Wrap each tool in try/except
   - Return {{"error": str(e)}} on failure

7. **Main Block (CRITICAL)**:
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       mcp.run()
   ```

CRITICAL CODE EXAMPLES:

Setup must use local .env file:
```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
from dotenv import load_dotenv

env_path = Path(__file__).parent / '.env'
load_dotenv(dotenv_path=env_path)
```

Transaction building for non-payable:
```python
txn = contract.functions.function_name(param1).buildTransaction({{
    'from': account.address,
    'nonce': web3.eth.get_transaction_count(account.address),
    'gas': 2000000,
    'gasPrice': web3.to_wei('20', 'gwei')
}})
signed_txn = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(txn, private_key=PRIVATE_KEY)
tx_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_txn.rawTransaction)
return {{"tx_hash": tx_hash.hex()}}
```

Transaction building for payable:
```python
txn = contract.functions.makePayment().buildTransaction({{
    'from': account.address,
    'nonce': web3.eth.get_transaction_count(account.address),
    'gas': 2000000,
    'gasPrice': web3.to_wei('20', 'gwei'),
    'value': web3.to_wei(5, 'ether')
}})
signed_txn = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(txn, private_key=PRIVATE_KEY)
tx_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_txn.rawTransaction)
return {{"tx_hash": tx_hash.hex()}}
```

View function:
```python
result = contract.functions.getBalance().call()
return {{"result": result}}
```

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Function names must match ABI exactly
- Include ALL functions from ABI
- Use @mcp.tool() decorator (not @tool())
- Load ABI from {contract_name}.abi.json file in same directory (do NOT hardcode ABI)
- Load .env from same directory as script
- ALWAYS initialize: account = web3.eth.account.from_key(PRIVATE_KEY)
- Use 'from': account.address in all transactions
- Use web3.eth.get_transaction_count(), NOT web3.eth.getTransactionCount()
- Use web3.to_wei(), NOT web3.toWei()
- Use web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(), NOT web3.eth.sendRawTransaction()
- Use Web3.to_checksum_address(), NOT Web3.toChecksumAddress()
- For payable functions, include 'value': web3.to_wei(amount, 'ether')
- File must be self-contained and runnable
